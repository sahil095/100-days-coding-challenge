# âœ… 1. **Most Common Solution** â€” **BFS** (Level-order Traversal)

### ðŸ§  Intuition:

- This is a classic **shortest path on unweighted grid** â†’ use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
- Each cell is a node; 8-directional movement = graph edges.
- Start from `(0, 0)` and expand level-by-level, marking visited nodes
- Have a visited array to mark each cell as True (visited)
- create a directions array to check for each direction
- if condition is important
